This project is regarding how to build house price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. After that I have written a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Further website built in html, css and javascript that allows to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and with the help of python flask server we can retrieve the predicted price. 

1. Jupyter notebook for working on dataset<br />
2. Data cleaning, data visualiztion using numpy, pandas, matplotlib<br />
3. Model Building using Sklearn<br />
4. Visual studio code for HTML/CSS/Javascript for building UI<br />
5. Pycharm for building Python flask for http server<br />
